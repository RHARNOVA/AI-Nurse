# AI-Nurse

## An application using OpenAI API written with Python and JavaScript which aims to automate paitent communication with healthcare services. 

The purpose of this application is to streamline communication between patients and their healthcare providers by using an intelligent chatbot which will primarily:

* determine possible causes for symptoms in patient based on the most current and accurate medical information on pathology
* provide empathetic and sound medical advice based on its analysis or answer general questions
* handle appointment booking, scheduling, and keeping track of patient related services such as prescriptions
* reading and update patient records to allow for more personalized services as well as informing healthcare providers on check-ins, areas of concern, updates on recovery, or any other important information

## Project Timeline

**Phase 1**

The primary feature of this app is the chatbot, so the first feature to be developed will be a webapp with the chatbot UI interface, and of course, the chatbot. This will primarily be programmed using ReactJS on the front end and Python's Flask framework on the backend. 

Goals: 
- Basic UI completed
- Quick and responsive chatbot
- Questions about symptoms and determines possible ailments
- Provides empathic medical advice (whether it will require training on medical information is TBD)

Expected completion: January 31st, 2025
Completed: TBD

**Phase 2**

The secondary and more backend heavy services like patient record management and scheduling will require more time and resources, and will be addressed in this phase.

Goals:
- Creating a database for patient information to be stored, read, and modified
- Chatbot will read/write/store patient files
- Chatbot will interact with scheduling API

Expected completion: TBD
Completion: TBD

**Phase 3**

Other features and the mobile app version will be addressed in this phase.

Goals: 
- Image generation model provides simple image multiple choice questions for patient to better describe symptoms (will require some training, source and method TBD)
- Mobile App

Expected completion: TBD
Completion: TBD

**Phase 4**

More complex features like computer vision and vocal conversations will be addressed in this phase.

- Chatbot and patient will converse vocally, and clearly
- Using computer vision to look at and possibly determine symptoms/give sound medical advice (will require training, source and method TBD)

Expected completion: TBD
Completion: TBD

**~**

Features, suggestions, and other ideas will be added to existing phases or will make new phases entirely. All is yet to be determined, however these 4 basic phases give an idea of the projected complexity and scale of the project.

## URV

This project is one of the subjects in an API Study Undergraduate Research Volunteering program at the Unviersity of Massachusetts Amherst, upon which a feasibility study will be created to determine the viability of the application.
