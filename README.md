# **Electronic Liaison for Intelligent Triage Automation (E.L.I.T.A.)**

E.L.I.T.A. is an application designed to automate "telephone triages" using a chatbot, enabling hospitals and clinics to handle preliminary triages for unlimited patients 24/7. By addressing challenges like long waiting periods, overburdened healthcare providers, disorganized scheduling systems, and inaccessible patient records, E.L.I.T.A. aims to make communication between patients and healthcare providers easier, faster, and more transparent.  

Similar to customer service chatbots used in banking and other industries, E.L.I.T.A. leverages AI to streamline and enhance patient care.

## **üí° App Features**  
E.L.I.T.A. streamlines communication between patients and healthcare providers using an intelligent chatbot that can:  

- **Analyze Symptoms:** Assess possible causes for patient symptoms using accurate and current medical information.  
- **Provide Medical Advice:** Offer empathetic, reliable guidance or answer general health-related questions.  
- **Handle Scheduling:** Manage appointment bookings, scheduling, and other patient services like prescription tracking.  
- **Access Patient Records:**  
  - Personalize communication based on patient history.  
  - Share updates with healthcare providers, including check-ins, areas of concern, or recovery progress.  

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview**

### **Front-End**  
- **React.js:** For a dynamic chatbot interface.  
- **Tailwind CSS:** For streamlined and modern UI/UX design.  

### **Back-End**  
- **Flask (Python):** For API integration and server-side functionality.  

### **APIs**  
- **[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview):** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model to power the chatbot.  
- **[Redox API](https://redoxengine.com/):** Integrates with scheduling systems and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to manage and access patient information.  

## **üóìÔ∏è Development Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Chatbot Core Functionality**  
**Focus:** For the intents of the [URV](#urv-program), primary focus is to develop the core AI chatbot functionality.  
**Goals:**  
- Complete chatbot UI.  
- Integrate OpenAI API into the application.  
- Create an automated triage experience (Q&A, advice generation).  

**Expected Completion:** January 31, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress  

### **Phase 2: Patient Record and Scheduling Integration**  
**Focus:** Simulate access to patient databases and scheduling functionality.  
**Goals:**  
- Build a database for patient information storage and updates.  
- Enable the chatbot to read/write patient files.  
- Integrate the chatbot with scheduling APIs.  

**Expected Completion:** TBD  
**Status:** Planned  

### **Phase 3: Advanced Triage Techniques**  
**Focus:** Expand chatbot capabilities with interactive graphics, voice communication, and computer vision.  
**Goals:**  
- Implement image-based symptom descriptions using AI-generated graphics.  
- Enable voice-based conversations between chatbot and patient.  
- Integrate computer vision for symptom analysis and medical advice.  

**Expected Completion:** TBD  
**Status:** Planned  

### **Phase 4: Redox API Integration**  
**Focus:** Fully integrate Redox API to access live hospital data and ensure compatibility with external healthcare systems.  
**Goals:**  
- Configure the chatbot to interact seamlessly with Redox API for real-world applications.  

**Expected Completion:** TBD  
**Status:** Planned  

### **Future Enhancements**  
New features, suggestions, and ideas will be integrated as the project evolves. These four phases outline the initial scope and complexity, with room for future expansions.
